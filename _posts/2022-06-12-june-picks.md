Apart from the countless down sides of staying at home, I did try my best to optimize the happiness by doing all possible things that can be done at home. And I thought it might be a good idea to actually write it down and share around. 

#### Books  
I'm not a frequent reader, but I've always tried to find pleasure and enlightment from the limited number of books I read. In May I finished reading a collection of Stefan Zweig's short stories and it was simply amazing. I like the delicate details of mental activities. One of the stories I enjoyed the most is _Compulsion_, which perfectly described the German artist's struggle between his self and his country. The author just left the audience with a bunch of questions as to what it means to be right or wrong, and who to judge. I also loved another one called _Chess Story_, which is very famous and was later made into a movie.  

#### Dramas  
I've watched both season 1 and 2 of the Korean series _Stranger_. It was relatively fast paced and I loved dramas very few lovelines and this one simply just clicked me. The stories were written perfectly and I just couldn't stop watching till the end. 

#### Baking  
Yeah I enjoyed making things by my own and baking has just simply become the most suited thing to do, although frankly speaking I'm totally not gifted and have bombed many recipes which claimed to be the easiest ones with 0% failure rate. But I did manage to make Ciabatta, Country Bread, and White Toast as well as Cinnamon Rolls. They are definitely far away from those made in bakeries but are good enough to be my breakfast every day.
