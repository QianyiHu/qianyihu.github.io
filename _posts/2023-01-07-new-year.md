title: Happy New Year 2023

Haven't written for a while. 2022 was a complicated year with ups and downs. Regardless, we've been through it and it's always good to have new beginnings. I used to make a list of new year resolutions but this year I hesitated a bit, mostly because no resolutions can be achieved without persistence and hard work. And simply drafting a wish list during January won't make it any easier.  

That being said, I still have hopes for this year and the coming future. I wish I will be healthier, tougher, with more courage and wisdom. Wish my family and my loved ones are all happy and healthy. I want to read more books (or at least the same as last year), try more new bread or pastry recipes, and try building some things, no matter how trivial it is. The world seems to have more chaos and become more unpredictable, but one must hold their faith, keep their inner peace, do what they can, and never give in.
